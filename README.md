Implement a JWT-based session management system for both email/password and Web3 authentication methods.
Users should maintain their sessions securely using the JWT tokens.  

* Secure Storage of Credentials:

Safely store user credentials and authentication-related information in the database.
Use proper encryption and security measures to protect sensitive data.  

* Authentication Portability:

Allow users to switch between email/password and Web3 authentication methods seamlessly.
